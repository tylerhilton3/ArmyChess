# Overview

This is a simple chess game that can be played with 2 players on the same device. It includes all formal chess rules, like en passant, castling, stalemate, etc. I added sound effects, an end screen, and a 5 minute timer for each player.

I created this project with the intent of exploring the chess mechanics more mathematically, since I enjoy playing chess on chess.com.

# Development Environment

I used Python as the programming language and pygame as the main game engine library. I also used system libraries like sys and os to manage file dependencies.

# Future Work

In the future I'll add networking features to make this game playable online.
